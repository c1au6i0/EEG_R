This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
front <- amp_ch$`amp-D-019.dat`

y <- front[ (48*60*2000):(48*60*2000 + 300 * 2000)]

plot(seq_along(y), y, type = "l" )
```



```{r}
front <- amp_ch$`amp-D-019.dat`

y <- front[ (8*60*2000):(8*60*2000 + 300 * 2000)]

plot(seq_along(y), y, type = "l" )
```
Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
